Submission instructions
    Submission will be in pairs (course partners) and will contain a short pdf report containing:

        1. Model architecture description and illustration, training procedure (hyperparameters,
           optimization details, etc.).

        2. Training convergence plots as a function of training time:
           GAN: discriminator and generator losses, VAE: reconstruction loss, and KL divergence.

        3. Summary of your attempts and conclusions. Your conclusions and explanations should be
           based on the actual results you received during your attempts. Include 1-2 pages of
           visualizations (the images your model produces and visualizations of the latent space).
